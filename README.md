# Welcome to Api source for One X

All of the environment variables you would need to set to get this running is present inside the docker-compose.yml file


This was in a private repo and has the secret keys for a few things in the code, so I moved this to a different repo with a single commit.


Feel free to fork this or raise PRs against this or even add feature requests as issues

## How to run this on local?

 - Install Docker
 - in the terminal inside this folder write `docker-compose up`
